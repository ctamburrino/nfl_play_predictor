## Problem
American Football is a strategy based game where critical offensive and defensive plays can drastically change the outcome of the game. 
Defensively, being able to predict your opponents plays and strategies can cause key stops to help limit the opponents opportunities to score. 
The two main offensive plays that are made by a team are passing plays and running plays. If the defense can predict with more accuracy when the 
offense will pass or run, they can generate formations to better stop these plays. Our AI model seeks to predict whether the next offensive play 
will be a run or pass (or specific formation) given down, distance from first down line, score differential, field position, and other factors. 
Our model will specifically look at the National Football League (NFL) teams and their previous playmaking decisions.

## Expected Outcomes

We expect to create a play prediction model with visualized tendencies for each team or situation. Our model will be able to predict to a higher 
degree of accuracy (compared to random guessing) when a team will run or pass the ball based on the circumstances that the team is in (downs, 
distance from the 1st down, score differential, and field position, etc.).
